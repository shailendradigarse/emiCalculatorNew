# Laravel Project Setup

## Overview

This task involves generating dynamic columns for each month between the minimum first_payment_date and maximum last_payment_date found in the loan_details table. The new columns will reflect the monthly payment status for each client based on the existing data, allowing for enhanced analysis of loan payment trends over time.

## Prerequisites

1. **PHP** (version 8.0 or higher)
2. **Composer** (for managing PHP dependencies)
3. **MySQL** (or any other compatible database)
4. **Node.js** (for running the development server)
5. **npm** (for managing JavaScript dependencies)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shailendradigarse/emiCalculatorNew.git
cd emiCalculatorNew
```
### 2. Install PHP Dependencies

Install the PHP dependencies using Composer:

```bash
composer install
```

### Configure Environment Variables

1. **Create the .env File**:

Copy the example environment file to create a new .env file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2 **Set Up Database Configuration**:

Open the .env file and configure your database settings:

```bash
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
```

Make sure to replace your_database_name, your_database_username, and your_database_password with your actual database credentials.

4. **Generate Application Key**:
Generate a new application key for the Laravel project:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```
5. **Run Migrations**:
Run the database migrations to set up the necessary tables:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```
6. **Install Node.js Dependencies**:

Install the Node.js dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
7. **Run Development Server**:
Start the development server to serve the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```
8. **Start PHP Server**:
Open a new terminal and start the PHP development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```
The application will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000 (or another port specified in the output).

9. **Run Seeders**:
To populate the database with initial data, run the following commands:

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=UserSeeder
```

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=LoanDetailsSeeder
```
10. **Login Details**:
You can use the following credentials to log in:

```bash
EmailAddress=developer@example.com
Password=Test@Password123#
```
